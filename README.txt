---=== OVERVIEW ===---
This is a simple Day Organiser Python3 script used to arrange events in an efficient
manner.

---=== DEBUGGING ===---
This program has been tested on Python 3.6.5 without any issues. If you run into any
errors please make sure you are on this version because it is known to work. If you
still are having issues on the aforementioned version, just send me a message on my
GitHub page (https://github.com/mattdocherty314)

---=== PROGRAM USE ===---
When asked to add events in the schedule name the event, start time (optional) and
duration. It will then use brute force (starting with the events with start times) to
slot in events throughout the day

---> TODO
- Allow the program to be run within the terminal
